CLOCK

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript clock that displays the current time with rotating clock hands. 
The clock hands rotate dynamically to represent the seconds, minutes, and hours.

Here's a breakdown of the code: 

The HTML structure consists of a <div> with the class "clock-face", which contains three child elements representing the hour hand, minute hand, and second hand.
CSS is used to style the clock, including its appearance, size, border, and shadows. Each hand (hour, minute, second) is styled to appear as a thin black line.
JavaScript is used to get the current time and calculate the rotation angle for each clock hand based on the current time. 
The setInterval function is used to update the clock every second by calling the setDate function.

The setDate function:

Retrieves the current time using new Date().
Calculates the rotation angle for each hand based on the current time.
Applies the rotation to each hand using CSS transform property.

Overall, this code creates a visually appealing analog clock that updates in real-time.
